<p>The Example Plugins table lets you find and install optional plugins that extend MLA features and provide examples you can adapt to your own application requirements.</p>
<p>All the example plugins are listed in the table, ordered by the plugin name. You can change the sort order by clicking on one of the blue column names.</p>
<p>You can use the Screen Options tab to choose which columns are displayed and how many items appear on each page of the display.</p>
<p>You can narrow the list by entering a keyword or phrase in the text box in the upper-right corner and clicking "Search Plugins". <strong>NOTE:</strong> The "Search Plugins" filter is &#8220;sticky&#8221;, i.e., it will persist as you resort the display or move from page to page. To clear it, delete the text and click "Search Plugins".</p>
<!-- template="mla-bulk-actions" -->
<!-- title="Bulk Actions" order="30" -->
<p>The &#8220;Bulk Actions&#8221; dropdown list works with the check box column to let you select many items at once. Click the check box in the column title row to select all items on the page, or click the check box in a row to select items individually.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve selected the items you want, pick an action from the dropdown list and click Apply to perform the action on the selected items.</p>
<p>Note that the "Install" action is ignored if the plugin already exists in the Plugins area, and "Update" is ignored for plugins that are not already installed.</p>
<p>For "Update", <strong>any changes you have made to the installed version will be lost.</strong></p>
<!-- template="mla-available-actions" -->
<!-- title="Available Actions" order="40" -->
<p>Hovering over a row in the Extension column reveals action links such as Install.</p>
<p>Clicking "Install" will copy the plugin to the WordPress Plugins/Installed Plugins area. Install is not available if the plugin is already in the Plugins area.</p>
<p>Clicking "Update" will replace the plugin already in the WordPress Plugins/Installed Plugins area. <strong>Any changes you have made to the installed version will be lost.</strong> Update is not available if the plugin is not already in the Plugins area.</p>
<p>Clicking "Download" will copy the plugin to your local system so you can inspect and modify it to meet your appication needs.</p>
<p>Clicking "View" will display the plugin file content. Many of the plugins have notes and user information at the top of the file.</p>
