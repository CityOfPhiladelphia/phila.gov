<p>You can use <strong>categories</strong> to define sections of your site and group related attachments. The default is &#8220;none&#8221;, i.e., the attachment is not associated with any category.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the difference between categories and tags? Normally, tags are ad-hoc keywords that identify important information about your attachment (names, subjects, etc) that may or may not apply to other attachments, while categories are pre-determined sections. If you think of your site like a book, the categories are like the Table of Contents and the tags are like the terms in the index.</p>
<p>You can change the display of this screen using the Screen Options tab to set how many items are displayed per screen and to display/hide columns in the table.</p>

<!-- title="Adding Categories" order="20" -->
<p>When adding a new category on this screen, you&#8217;ll fill in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - The name is how it appears on your site.</li>
<li><strong>Slug</strong> - The &#8220;slug&#8221; is the URL-friendly version of the name. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers and hyphens.</li>
<li><strong>Parent</strong> - Categories, unlike tags, can have a hierarchy. You might for example have a Landscape category, and under that have children categories for Mountains and Seashore. Totally optional. To create a subcategory, just choose another category from the Parent dropdown.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong> - The description is not prominent by default; however, some themes may display it.</li>
</ul>
<!-- template="mla-attachments-column" -->
<!-- title="Attachments Column" order="30" -->
<p>The &#8220;Attachments&#8221; column at the right of the table gives you the number of attachments associated with each category. You can click on the number to get a list of all the attachments with that category. The heading on the list page(s) will display the category value you&#8217;ve selected.</p>
