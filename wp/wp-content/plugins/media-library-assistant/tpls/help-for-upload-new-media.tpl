<p>The &#8220;Bulk Edit Area&#8221; lets you change the metadata (author, parent, taxonomy terms) for all uploaded attachments as they are added to the Media Library. <strong>IMPORTANT: Make your entries BEFORE uploading new items.</strong>
<p>Bulk Edit support for taxonomy terms allows you to <strong>add</strong> terms for the selected attachments. Below each taxonomy edit box are three radio buttons that let you select the action you&#8217;d like to perform. Since the new items don't have any existing terms, leave the <strong>add</strong> default setting.</p>
<p>The taxonomies that appear in the Bulk Edit area can be a subset of the taxonomies supported on the single item edit screen. You can select which taxonomies appear by entering your choice(s) in the Inline Edit column of the Taxonomy Support section on the Settings/Media Library Assistant General tab.</p>
<p>You can update the Title, Caption, Description and ALT Text values for all of the uploaded attachments. You can use a <a href="[+settingsURL+]?page=mla-settings-menu-documentation&mla_tab=documentation#mla_template_parameters" target="_blank">Content Template</a> to customize the values based on attachment-specific data sources.</p>
<p>You can set a post or page as the parent for uploaded items; use the "Select" button to pop up a list of the posts and pages you can select from.</p>
<p>If you have defined Custom Field mapping rules and checked the "Bulk Edit" box for one or more fields, they will appear in the Bulk Edit Area and you can assign values to them.</p>
<p>Once you have filled in the values you want to assign you can click the "Close Bulk Edit Area" button to free up screen area for the list of uploaded files. Even though the Area is closed, your entries will persist until you have left the Upload New Media screen.</p>
