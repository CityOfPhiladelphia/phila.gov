# How To Translate Meta Box

## Who translates Meta Box? How can I get involved?

Anyone can help by suggesting new translations [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/meta-box). No need to use a translation editor, you can do it all from the web interface.

Once you've suggested a new translation, a language validator will review it. They will then approve, reject, or change your suggestions. Once your changes get approved, they are automatically included in the next Meta Box release.

## Who decides which languages are available? I want my language added

If you can't find your language, [send us an email](https://metabox.io) and we'll add it for you.

## I want to change translations locally. Where can I download the .PO file for my language?

You'll find options to create a .PO file and export translations at the bottom of each language page.
