Use the admin email address as the from email address

== Description ==
Use the admin email address set in Settings->General as the email address from which WordPress sends email.

The plugin has two easy settings and programmer hook support to set as new From email address and a From name. It also should work perfectly fine with Multisite installations.


== Screenshots ==

1. A screenshot of the WordPress Settings->General section with the admin email field marked red.
2. A screenshot of the WordPress Settings->General section with the extra fields for setting the From email address and name.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `admin-email-as-from-address` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Done!

== Notes == 

Since version 1.1 you may also overrule this plugin by using the following filters: 

- aeafa_mail_from, [similar to wp_mail_from](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_mail_from/)  
- aeafa_mail_from_name, [similar to wp_mail_from_name](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/wp_mail_from_name/)

These work exactly the same as their core WordPress counterparts and allows you to implement your own mail_from and mail_from_name
