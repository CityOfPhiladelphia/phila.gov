**Do not send pull requests on GitHub for adding translations files here.**

**Do not place your own translations file in this directory locally or they will be deleted at the next plugin update.**

If you want to add custom translations in your local copy, you may place them in `/wp-content/languages/simple-calendar/`. 

Keep in mind that custom translations will override translations for the same languages provided by the plugin.
