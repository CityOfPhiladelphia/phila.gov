The Wordfence WordPress security plugin provides free enterprise-class WordPress security, protecting your website from hacks and malware.
== Description ==
= THE MOST DOWNLOADED WORDPRESS SECURITY PLUGIN =

Wordfence starts by checking if your site is already infected. We do a deep server-side scan of your source code comparing it to the Official WordPress repository for core, themes and plugins. Then Wordfence secures your site and makes it up to 50 times faster. 

Wordfence Security is 100% free and open source. We also offer a Premium API key that gives you Premium Support, Country Blocking, Scheduled Scans, Password Auditing and we even check if your website IP address is being used to Spamvertize. [Click here to sign-up for Wordfence Premium now](http://www.wordfence.com/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=pluginDescCTA) or simply install Wordfence free and start protecting your website.

Wordfence Security is now Multi-Site compatible and includes Cellphone Sign-in which permanently secures your website from brute force hacks. 

= WORDFENCE WORDPRESS SECURITY FEATURES =

= Blocking Features =
* Real-time blocking of known attackers. If another site using Wordfence is attacked and blocks the attacker, your site is automatically protected.
* Block entire malicious networks. Includes advanced IP and Domain WHOIS to report malicious IP's or networks and block entire networks using the firewall. Report security threats to network owner.
* Rate limit or block security threats like aggressive crawlers, scrapers and bots doing security scans for vulnerabilities in your site.
* Choose whether you want to block or throttle users and robots who break your security rules.
* Premium users can also block countries and schedule scans for specific times and a higher frequency.

= Login Security =
* Sign-in using your password and your cellphone to vastly improve login security. This is called Two Factor Authentication and is used by banks, government agencies and military world-wide for highest security authentication. 
* Includes two-factor authentication, also referred to as cellphone sign-in. 
* Enforce strong passwords among your administrators, publishers and users. Improve login security.
* Checks the strength of all user and admin passwords to enhance login security.
* Includes login security to lock out brute force hacks and to stop WordPress from revealing info that will compromise security.

= Security Scanning =
* Scans for the HeartBleed vulnerability - included in the free scan for all users. 
* Scans core files, themes and plugins against WordPress.org repository versions to check their integrity. Verify security of your source.
* See how files have changed. Optionally repair changed files that are security threats.
* Scans for signatures of over 44,000 known malware variants that are known security threats.
* Scans for many known backdoors that create security holes including C99, R57, RootShell, Crystal Shell, Matamu, Cybershell, W4cking, Sniper, Predator, Jackal, Phantasma, GFS, Dive, Dx and many many more.
* Continuously scans for malware and phishing URL's including all URL's on the Google Safe Browsing List in all your comments, posts and files that are security threats.
* Scans for heuristics of backdoors, trojans,  suspicious code and other security issues.

= WordPress Firewall =
* Includes a firewall to block common security threats like fake Googlebots, malicious scans from hackers and botnets.

= Monitoring Features =
* See all your traffic in real-time, including robots, humans, 404 errors, logins and logouts and who is consuming most of your content. Enhances your situational awareness of which security threats your site is facing.
* A real-time view of all traffic including automated bots that often constitute security threats that Javascript analytics packages never show you.
* Real-time traffic includes reverse DNS and city-level geolocation. Know which geographic area security threats originate from.
* Monitor your DNS security for unauthorized DNS changes.
* Monitors disk space which is related to security because many DDoS attacks attempt to consume all disk space to create denial of service.

= Multi-Site Security =
* Wordfence Security for multi-site also scans all posts and comments across all blogs from one admin panel.
* WordPress Multi-Site (or WordPress MU in the older parlance) compatible.

= Caching Features =
* Includes Falcon Engine, the fastest WordPress caching engine available today. Falcon is faster because it reduces your web server disk and database activity to a minimum.
* Wordfence includes two caching modes for compatability and has cache management features like the ability to clear the cache and monitor cache usage. 

= IPv6 Compatible =
* Fully IPv6 compatible including all whois lookup, location, blocking and security functions.

= Major Theme and Plugins Supported =
* Includes support for other major plugins and themes like WooCommerce.

The Wordfence WordPress security plugin is full-featured and constantly updated by our team to incorporate the latest security features and to hunt for the newest security threats to your WordPress website.

== Installation ==

To install the Wordfence WordPress security plugin and start protecting your WordPress website:

1. Install Wordfence Security automatically or by uploading the ZIP file. 
1. Activate the security plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Wordfence WordPress Security is now activated. Go to the scan menu and start your first security scan. Scheduled security scanning will also be enabled.
1. Once your first scan has completed a list of security threats will appear. Go through them one by one to secure your site.
1. Visit the Wordfence Security options page to enter your email address so that you can receive email security alerts.
1. Optionally change your security level or adjust the advanced options to set individual security scanning and protection options for your site.
1. Click the "Live Traffic" menu option to watch your site activity in real-time. Situational awareness is an important part of website security.

To install the Wordfence WordPress security plugin on WordPress Multi-Site installations:

1. Install Wordfence Security via the plugin directory or by uploading the ZIP file.
1. Network Activate Wordfence Security. This step is important because until you network activate it, your sites will see the plugin option on their plugins menu. Once activated that option dissapears. 
1. Now that Wordfence is network activated it will appear on your Network Admin menu. Wordfence Security will not appear on any individual site's menu. 
1. Go to the "Scan" menu and start your first security scan. 
1. Wordfence Security will do a security scan of all files in your WordPress installation including those in the blogs.dir directory of your individual sites. 
1. Live Traffic will appear for ALL sites in your network. If you have a heavily trafficked system you may want to disable live traffic which will stop logging to the DB. 
1. Firewall rules and login rules apply to the WHOLE system. So if you fail a login on site1.example.com and site2.example.com it counts as 2 failures. Crawler traffic is counted between blogs, so if you hit three sites in the network, all the hits are totalled and that counts as the rate you're accessing the system.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

[Visit our support website which contains a FAQ and knowledgebase which is more comprehensive and updated frequently.](http://support.wordfence.com/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=pluginDesc)

= What does Wordfence Security do that other WordPress security plugins don't do? =

* Wordfence Security is the only WordPress security plugin that is fully integrated with it's own high speed caching engine to avoid security and caching conflicts. 
* Wordfence Security actually verifies your website source code integrity against the official WordPress repository and shows you the changes. We are the only plugin to do this.
* Wordfence Security provides two-factor authentication (Cellphone Sign-in) for paid members. We're the first plugin to offer this.
* Wordfence Security fully supports IPv6 including giving you the ability to look up the location of IPv6 addresses, block IPv6 ranges, detect IPv6 country and do a whois lookup on IPv6 addresses and more.
* Wordfence Security includes protection against DDoS attacks by giving you a performance boost up to 50X. 
* Wordfence Security scans check all your files, comments and posts for URL's in Google's Safe Browsing list. We are the only plugin to offer this very important security enhancement.
* Wordfence Security scans do not consume large amounts of your precious bandwidth because all security scans happen on your web server which makes them very fast.
* Wordfence Security fully supports WordPress Multi-Site which means you can security scan every blog in your Multi-Site installation with one click.
* Wordfence Security includes Two-Factor authentication, the most secure way to stop brute force attackers in their tracks. 

= Does Wordfence Security support Multi-Site installations? =

Yes. WordPress MU or Multi-Site as it's called now is fully supported. Using Wordfence Security you can security scan every blog in your network with one click. If one of your customers posts a page or post with a known malware URL that threatens your whole domain with being blacklisted by Google, we will tell you within a maximum of one hour which is how often scans occur. 

= Will Wordfence Security slow my site down? =

No. Actually it will make your site up to 50X faster when Falcon Engine is enabled, up to 30 times faster with our PHP caching engine and even
without caching Wordfence is extremely fast and uses techniques like caching it's own configuration data to avoid database lookups. Older
versions of Wordfence did incur a slight performance penalty, but we have not only fixed this issue but knocked it out of the park. Wordfence
now makes your site faster than any other caching plugin available!! 

= How often is Wordfence Security updated? =

The Wordfence Security plugin is frequently updated and we update the code on our security scanning servers
more frequently. Our cloud servers are continually updated with the latest known security threats and vulnerabilities so
that we can blog any security threat as soon as it emerges in the wild.

= What if I need support? =

All our paid customers receive priority support. Excellent customer service is a key part
of being a Wordfence Security member. As free or Premium member can visit [support.wordfence.com](http://support.wordfence.com/?utm_source=repo&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=pluginDesc) and where you will find out knowledgebase. If you're a Premium member you can also open a support ticket.

= Can I disable certain security features of Wordfence Security? =

Yes! Simply visit the Options page, click on advanced options and enable or disable the security features you want.

= What if my site security has already been compromised by a hacker? =

Wordfence Security is the only WordPress security plugin that is able to repair core files, themes and plugins on sites where security is already compromised.
However, please note that site security can not be assured unless you do a full reinstall if your site has been hacked. We recommend you only
use Wordfence Security to get your site into a running state in order to recover the data you need to do a full reinstall. A full reinstall is the only
way to ensure site security once you have been hacked. 

= How will I be alerted that my site has a security problem? =

Wordfence Security sends security alerts via email. Once you install Wordfence Security, you will configure a list of email addresses where security alerts will be sent.
When you receive a security alert, make sure you deal with it promptly to ensure your site stays secure.

= My WordPress site is behind a firewall. Doesn't that make it secure? =

If your site is accessible from the web, it means that people you don't know can execute PHP code on your site.
They have to be able to execute PHP code, like the core WordPress code, in order for your site to work. 
Most WordPress security threats allow a hacker to execute PHP code on your website. The challenge hackers
face is how to get their malicious PHP code onto your site to compromise your security. There
are many upload mechanisms that WordPress itself, themes and plugins offer and the vast majority of these
are secure. However, every now and then a hacker discovers an upload mechanism that is not secure or 
a way of fooling your site into allowing an upload. That is usually when security is compromised. Even
though your site is behind a commercial firewall, it still accepts web requests that include uploads and executes PHP code
and as long as it does that, it may become face a security vulnerability at some point.

= Will Wordfence Security protect me against the Timthumb security problem? =

The timthumb security exploit occurred in 2011 and all good plugins and themes now use an updated 
version of timthumb (which the creator of Wordfence Security wrote and donated to the timthumb author) which closes the security hole that
caused the problem. However we do scan for old version of timthumb for good measure to make sure they don't 
cause a security hole on your site. 

= Does Wordfence Security support IPv6? =

Most definitely! As of Wordfence version 6.0.1 we fully support IPv6 with all security functions including country blocking, range blocking,
city lookup, whois lookup and all other security functions. If you are not running IPv6 Wordfence will work great on your site too. We are
fully compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6 whether you run both or only one addressing scheme. 

== Screenshots ==

1. The home screen of Wordfence Security where you can see a summary, manage security issues and do a manual security scan. 
2. The Live Traffic view of Wordfence Security where you can see real-time activity on your site.
3. The "Blocked IPs" page where you can manage blocked IP's, locked out IP's and see recently throttled IPs that violated security rules.
4. The basic view of Wordfence Security options. There is very little to configure other than your alert email address and security level.
5. If you're technically minded, this is the under-the-hood view of Wordfence Security options where you can fine-tune your security settings.

* Only scan files in the WordPress ABSPATH root directory and known WordPress subdirectories. Prevents potentially massive scans on hosts that have large dirs off their wordpress root.
* Don't generate plain SHA hashes anymore because we don't currently use them on the server side for scanning. (Still generates md5's and SHAC)
* No longer do change tracking on files before scans because the change tracking does almost the same amount of work when generating hashes as the actual scan. So just do the scan, which is now faster.
* Updated internal version to 1.2 to use new code on the server side which sends back a list of unknown files rather than known files, which is usually smaller and more network efficient.
* Improved logging in activity log.

* Removed status updates during post and comment scans which prevents interference with unbuffered queries and makes the scans even faster.

= 1.3.1 =
* Fixed a bug where if you have the plugin "secure-wordpress" installed, you can't do a Wordfence Security scan because it says you have the wrong version. This is because secure-wordpress trashes the $wp_version global variable to hide your version rather than using the filters provided by WordPress. So coded a workaround so that your Wordfence Security scans will work with that plugin installed.

= 1.3 =
* Minor fix to point to the correct binary API URL on the Wordfence Security cloud servers.

= 1.2 =
* It is now free to get a Wordfence Security API key.

== Upgrade Notice ==
= 3.1.1 =
Upgrade immediately. Fixes bug introduced in last release that broke permenent IP blocking.

= 3.0.9 =
Upgrade immediately. Fixes two security critical bugs: Could not get admin ID bug and permanent IP blocks not staying permanent. 

= 3.0.6 =
Upgrade immediately. Improves malware URL detection by 20% or more to improve security.

= 3.0.3 =
Upgrade immediately. This release fixes an issue that caused Wordfence Security to show all your core files
missing under certain conditions. It was usually caused by high load on our scanning server and the
plugin not handling an error condition halfway through the scan correctly.

= 3.0.2 =
Upgrade immediately. This release drastically reduces memory, reduces new DB connections created by 
Wordfence Security to zero (we simply reuse the WordPress DB handle), reduces the number of DB queries to 
about 1% of the previous version by removing unneeded status messages and fixes a bug that 
could cause Wordfence Security to launch multiple concurrent scans that can put high load on your system.
This is a critical release. Upgrade immediately.
