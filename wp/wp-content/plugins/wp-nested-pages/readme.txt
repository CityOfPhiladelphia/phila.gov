== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use Nested Pages with other post types? =
Yes! Visit Settings > Nested Pages > Post Types to enable the interface for any public post type. There are settings available for each post type, allowing customization of the admin to fit your needs.

= Is this plugin compatible with the WPML plugin? =
Please see the section titled "WMPL Compatibility" for details on using Nested Pages with WPML. In short, ordering and nesting functionality is available, but automatic menu generation across languages is limited. It is advised to use WPML's menu synchronization for this purpose.

= How do I access the WordPress "Pages" screen? =
Click the “Default link in the page subnav, or on the Nested Pages screen. This item may be optionally hidden under the Nested Pages "Post Type" settings.

= How do I save the order I create? =
Post sorting and nesting is saved in the background after changes are made to the structure. If the "manual page order" option is enabled in the plugin options, you'll need to click the "Sync Order" button at the top of the page to save.

= How do I edit in bulk? =
To bulk edit, check the checkbox on the pages/posts you'd like to edit. Once one or more have been selected, a "Bulk Actions" dropdown will appear, allowing you to either move the selected posts to the trash or bulk edit.

= What about custom columns? =
Custom columns are not currently supported by Nested Pages. To view custom columns, click on the "Default" link to view the native interface. If you are using WordPress SEO by Yoast, a page analysis indicator is shown.

= What are those dots in my page rows? =
If you have WordPress SEO by Yoast installed, your page score indicators are shown along with the pages.

= Can I show the thumbnail in the tree view? =
Yes! Visit Settings > Nested Pages > Post Types to configure thumbnail settings for each post type. Filters are also available for customizing the images displayed, as well as specifying a fallback image in the case that the post does not have a thumbnail assigned.

= Nested Pages changes my permalink structure. How do I stop that? =
Nested Pages uses the same ordering methodology as WordPress core. The plugin offers an enhanced interface to achieve the same results. Parent/Child relationships are used in conjunction with the post menu_order field to nest and order posts/pages. There is currently no option to disable this core feature.

= Can I generate a menu using a custom post type? =
No. The menu synchronization currently only works within the pages post type.

Several new features have been added in version 1.1, including: saved toggle states, additional menu options, trash functionality, ability to add "link" menu items, and more.

== More Information ==

= Generated Menu =
The default menu generated automatically is named "Nested Pages". You may rename the menu under Appearance > Menus, or under the Nested Pages settings.


= Toggling the Page Tree =

To toggle the child pages in and out of view, click the arrow to the left of a parent page. To quickly expand and collapse all pages, click the button in the upper right corner of the Nested Pages Screen. 


= Theme Use =

To order by nested pages ordering in your theme, use the `menu_order` order option in your queries. 


= Hiding Pages from the Tree View =

To hide a page from the tree view, open the quick edit form, select the option to “Hide in Nested Pages” and click Update to save the change.

To toggle the page back into view, click the “Show Hidden Pages” link at the top of the screen. The hidden pages are now visible, and can be re-edited to be shown.


= Sorting Pages =

To sort pages, hover over the page row. A menu icon (three lines) will appear. Click (or tap) this icon and drag to reorder within the menu. To drag a page underneath another, drag the page to the right and underneath the target parent. Visual indication is provided with an indentation. The drag and drop functionality works similarly to WordPress menus.

= Menu Sync =

After installing Nested Pages, a new menu will be available with the name `Nested Pages`. By default, menu syncing is enabled. To disable the sync, uncheck “Sync Menu” at the top of the Nested Pages screen. Recheck the box to enable it again and to run the sync. 

**Saving Performance:** If your site has a very large number of pages, disabling page sync may help speed up the save time when using Nested Pages.

**Editing the generated menu:** Any manual changes made to the menu outside of the Nested Pages interface will be overwritten after the synchronization runs.

**Hiding Pages in the Menu:** To hide a page from the Nested Pages menu, click “Quick Edit” on it’s row, select “Hide in Nav Menu”, and click “update”. If menu sync is disabled, enable it now to sync the setting. Hidden pages are marked “(Hidden)”. If a page with child pages is hidden from the menu, all of it’s child pages will also be hidden. 


= WPML Compatibility =

As of version 2.0.1, some features of Nested Pages are compatible with WPML. There are some important exceptions to take note of before upgrading to version 2 if WPML is installed, or if installing WPML on an existing Nested Pages enabled site.

**WPML and menu support:** Certain features within Nested Pages are disabled if WPML is installed and enabled. This is due to the complexity of menu synchronization across languages. While automatic menu sync remains available for the site's primary language, additional languages must be synchronized using WPML's menu synchronization methods. If menu sync is enabled within Nested Pages, a "Sync WPML Menus" link is available on non-primary language screens for convenience.

**Custom Links:** Custom links within Nested Pages are disabled on installs with WPML. Custom links may be added through the traditional Appearance > Menus interface. This ensures that WPML menus synchronize successfully across languages.


= Filters =

* `the_title($title, $post_id, $view)` – Standard title filter. Applied to the title displayed in the nested interface. A third paramater, $view, is passed to check if the current title is being displayed in the nested view.
* `nestedpages_thumbnail($image, $post)` – Customize the thumbnail for each page/post. Note: Thumbnails must be enabled for the post type.
* `nestedpages_thumbnail_fallback($image, $post)` - Customize the thumbnail fallback for each page/post (if the post does not have a featured image). Note: Thumbnails must be enabled for the post type.
* `nestedpages_edit_link($link, $post)` - Customize the "edit" link for each page/post in the nested interface.
* `nestedpages_edit_link_text($text, $post)` - Customize the "edit" link text for each page/post in the nested interface.
* `nestedpages_view_link($link, $post)` - Customize the "view" button link for each page/post in the nested interface.
* `nestedpages_view_link_text($text, $post)` - Customize the "view" button text for each page/post in the nested interface.
